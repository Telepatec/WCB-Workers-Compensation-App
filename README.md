# ðŸ¤– WCB Workers' Injury Claims Prediction App 

"The New York Workersâ€™ Compensation Board (WCB) administers and regulates workersâ€™ compensation, disability, volunteer firefighters, volunteer ambulance workers, and volunteer civil defense workersâ€™ benefits. As the regulating authority, the WCB is responsible for assembling and deciding on claims whenever it becomes aware of a workplace injury. Since 2000, the WCB has assembled and reviewed more than 5 million claims. However, manually reviewing all claims is an arduous and time-consuming process. For that reason, the WCB has reached out to Nova IMS to assist them in the creation of a model that can automate the decision-making whenever a new claim is received."
